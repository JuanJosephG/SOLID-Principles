# SOLID-Principles
The SOLID Principles are a set of five software design principles that, when applied correctly, facilitate the creation of clean, modular, and maintainable code. These principles were proposed by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob) in the early 2000s as a guide for writing more robust and scalable code.

Below, each of the five SOLID principles is briefly described:

1. **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility in the system. Separating responsibilities into individual classes makes the code more maintainable and flexible.

2. **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
The OCP suggests that classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that the code should be easy to extend without needing to modify existing code.

3. **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
This principle states that objects of a base class should be replaceable with objects of its derived classes without affecting the correct behavior of the program. In other words, subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.

4. **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:
The ISP states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Instead of having one large interface covering all possible operations, it's preferable to have several smaller, more specific interfaces.

5. **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
The DIP states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but rather on abstractions. This translates to implementation details depending on abstractions, not the other way around.
